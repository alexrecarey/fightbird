# Fightbird
### a Warcrow dice calculator using icepool

Fightbird is small web app that can calculate the results from
die rolls in Warcrow.

This app is still in active development and will feature breaking changes. 

It's a static, single page application written in Javascript using react. 
The site does not require any backend other than a webserver to serve the files.
The actual die probability rolls are done using the incredible 
[icepool](https://github.com/HighDiceRoller/icepool) library. 
To run python on the client side web browser, we use WASM and the Pyodide
library.

# Installing

I use [volta](https://volta.sh/) to sync versions of node and yarn. Once
that is installed, a simple `yarn` command should get you running.

# Contributing

Pull requests and contributions are welcome, but I do have a vision for this
project and I suggest you write in first.

# Other projects

[Infinity the Calculator](https://infinitythecalculator.com) is the first dice calculator
I wrote and is much more mature and fully featured.
